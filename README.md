## Overview of the project

### Project: data analysis with complex queries

## Objective

**Find Trends**: Discover changes over time.

**Do Detailed Calculations**: Calculate totals, averages, ranks, etc.

**Simplify Queries**: Make complex queries easier to read and manage.

**Segment Data**: Analyze specific groups within your data.

**Compare Metrics**: Compare different groups or time periods.

**Improve Decisions**: Use data insights to make better decisions.

### Key Activities

**Data Extraction**: Retrieve relevant data from databases using SQL queries.

**Data Cleaning**: Ensure the data is accurate and ready for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

**Using Subqueries**: Write nested queries to break down complex tasks into manageable parts.

**Applying Window Functions**: Perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row for advanced metrics.

**Using CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Create temporary result sets to simplify and structure complex queries.

**Aggregating Data**: Summarize data using functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.

**Filtering Data**: Use WHERE clauses and HAVING clauses to focus on relevant data subsets.

**Joining Tables**: Combine data from multiple tables using JOIN operations.

**Analyzing Results**: Interpret the outputs to identify trends, patterns, and insights.

**Reporting**: Compile your findings into a clear and comprehensive report.

### technologies used

- **mysql**:an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used 
            for web applications and small to medium-sized projects.

- **oracle**:a commercial relational database management system developed by Oracle 
             Corporation.
  
### key insights

**Trends Over Time**: Identifying patterns like sales growth, seasonal changes, or user behavior over different periods.

**Performance Metrics**: Calculating running totals, averages, and rankings to understand performance at different levels.

**Comparative Analysis**: Comparing different segments such as regions, products, or customer groups to see how they differ.

**Data Segmentation**: Analyzing specific subsets of data, like top-performing products or high-value customers.

**Anomalies and Outliers**: Detecting unusual patterns or data points that deviate from the norm.

**Correlations**: Finding relationships between different variables, like the effect of marketing campaigns on sales.

**Efficiency**: Simplifying complex queries to improve readability and performance.

**Predictive Insights**: Using historical data to forecast future trends and make data-driven predictions.
